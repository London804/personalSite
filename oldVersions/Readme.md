My personal website. My inspiration was based on a minimal design that was meant to only give what was necessary. I choose a grayscale color palate.
Originally the website was built using node.js however because of problems hosting, I also created a basic HTML site. In the future I will attempt to host it again
using Node.js. Either way the code for Node.js is here.
